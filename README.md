# Rust LeetCode

This is a repository containing a set of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
problems solved using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The main goal of this project is to use the Rust language in different
scenarios while solving the coding problems, improving my knowledge about
the programming language and how to overcome the [famous Rust compiler fights](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/du63ok/how_do_i_stop_fighting_randomly_with_the_compiler/).

Each LeetCode problem has it's own `.rs` file inside the `src/` folder. The
name of the file corresponds to the name of the problem written on the website.
